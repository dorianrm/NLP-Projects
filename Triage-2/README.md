# Triage - Naive Bayes

This project implements a Naive Bayes alorightm utilizing laplace add-1 smoothing to accomplish text classification. The text included involves text messages, social media posts, and snippets from new articles. Naive Bayes is used to classify whether these pieces of text are either asking/discussing the need for aid, or not aid. For instance, a snippet involving the sentence, "Help! My family is in need of food and water!" would be classified as 'aid'. A training set is included in order to train the algorithm. The test set included can be used to quantify the accuracy of the classification algorithm.
